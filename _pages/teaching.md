*Spearheaded the creation of supplementary instruction bootcamps built into course infrastructure.*

I realized there was a need for students to receive assistance with both conceptual and concrete
skills; specifically debugging as well as memory and proofs were weakpoints for
students. [Liz Chu](mailto:echu2@andrew.cmu.edu) and I proposed the project and
we have since fully developed and presented four bootcamps. We hope to observe improvement in
these topics.

More personally, these bootcamps made me realize that I really enjoy the development and the
process of teaching! They spur me on to pursue a PhD and likely continue in academia afterwards.


Below, I show examples of content from the bootcamps. The code for the examples is not
made public, but I include some of the presentations that we have created.
Each bootcamp typically has around 12 to 16 examples with a presentation, a resource document, and an examples instruction set
as a reference for students.
