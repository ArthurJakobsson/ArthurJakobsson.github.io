I'm a senior at Carnegie Mellon University, pursuing Statistics and Machine Learning with a minor in Computer Science. I am interested in robotics, computer vision, and machine learning! I'm involved in research on understanding textile deformation with ML for use in manipulation. Previously, I worked on image segmentation in few-shot environments and ML-based robotics path planning. I have written two first author papers as part of Maxim Likhachev's SBPL Lab, more details about these can be found on my CV.

I am planning on pursuing a PhD in Robotics and Machine Learning. I enjoy teaching and have been a TA (and lead TA) for the computer science class [15122 Principles of Imperative Computation](https://csd.cmu.edu/course-profiles/15-122-principles-imperative-computation) for five semesters. I discuss exciting changes to the course that I am leading development of in [teaching](/teaching).

I also love birdwatching, wildlife photography, biking, and badminton.
