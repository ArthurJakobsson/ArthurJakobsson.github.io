I'm a senior at Carnegie Mellon University, pursuing Statistics and Machine Learning with a minor in Computer Science. I am interested in computer vision, robotics, and computer security! I'm involved in research on image segmentation in few-shot environments and ML-based robotics path planning.

I am planning on pursuing a PhD in Computer Vision. I enjoy teaching and have been a TA (and lead TA) for the computer science class [15122 Principles of Imperative Computation](https://csd.cmu.edu/course-profiles/15-122-principles-imperative-computation) for four semesters. I discuss exciting changes to the course that I am leading development of in [teaching](/teaching).

I also love birdwatching, wildlife photography, biking, and badminton.
