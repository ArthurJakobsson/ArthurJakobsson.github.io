I'm a junior at Carnegie Mellon University, pursuing Statistics and Machine Learning with a minor in Computer Science. I am interested in computer vision, computer security and robotics! I'm involved in research on detecting deepfakes and robotics path planning, both of which have a paper in the works.

I love birdwatching, wildlife photography, biking, and badminton. Check out my [projects](/projects) page to see what I have been up to!

[Publications](/publications) currently contains my writing about topics from Internet tracking during COVID to OpenCV tutorials. My favorite page, I wrote with my friends where we statistically analyzed and visualized rat population data in correlation with various environmental factors in NYC (which won $70 for each of us!).

I am thinking of pursuing a PhD in Computer Vision! I enjoy teaching and have been a TA (and lead TA) for the computer science class [15122 Principles of Imperative Computation](https://csd.cmu.edu/course-profiles/15-122-principles-imperative-computation) for four semesters. I discuss exciting changes to the course that I am leading development of in [teaching](/teaching).
