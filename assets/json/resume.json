To our best knowledge, we demonstrate the first time ML-based MAPF approaches have scaled to similar high congestion as state-of-the-art heuristic search methods."},{"name":"AI-assisted Tagging of Deepfake Audio Calls using Challenge-Response","publisher":"arXiv (submitted to SOUPS 2024)","releaseDate":"2024-02-28","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18085","summary":"Scammers are aggressively leveraging AI voice-cloning technology for social engineering attacks, a situation significantly worsened by the advent of audio Real-time Deepfakes (RTDFs). RTDFs can clone a target's voice in real-time over phone calls, making these interactions highly interactive and thus far more convincing. Existing literature has largely been ineffective against RTDF threats. We introduce a robust challenge-response-based method to detect deepfake audio calls with high accuracy."}],"skills":[],"languages":[{"language":"English","fluency":"Native speaker"},{"language":"Swedish","fluency":"Conversational"},{"language":"Thai","fluency":"Elementary"},{"language":"Japanese","fluency":"Elementary"},{"language":"Spanish","fluency":"Elementary"}],"interests":[],"references":[],"projects":[]}
