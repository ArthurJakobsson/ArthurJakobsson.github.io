The MAPF community has largely focused on developing high-performance heuristic search methods. Recently, several works have applied various machine learning (ML) techniques to solve MAPF, usually involving sophisticated architectures, reinforcement learning techniques, and set-ups, but none using large amounts of high-quality supervised data. Our initial objective in this work was to show how simple large scale imitation learning of high-quality heuristic search methods can lead to state-of-the-art ML MAPF performance. However, we find that, at least with our model architecture, simple large scale (700k examples with hundreds of agents per example) imitation learning does \textit{not} produce impressive results. Instead, we find that by using prior work that post-processes MAPF model predictions to resolve 1-step collisions (CS-PIBT), we can train a simple ML MAPF model in minutes that dramatically outperforms existing ML MAPF policies. This has serious implications for all future ML MAPF policies (with local communication) which currently struggle to scale. In particular, this finding implies that future learnt policies should (1) always use smart 1-step collision shields (e.g. CS-PIBT), (2) always include the collision shield with greedy actions as a baseline (e.g. PIBT) and (3) motivates future models to focus on longer horizon / more complex planning as 1-step collisions can be efficiently resolved."},{"name":"Improving Learnt Local MAPF Policies with Heuristic Search","publisher":"International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS 2024)","releaseDate":"2024-02-12","url":"https://openreview.net/forum?id=6JEBeiztNT","summary":"We improve a ML local policy by using heuristic search methods on the output probability distribution to resolve deadlocks and enable full horizon planning for Multi Agent Planning (MAPF). We show several model-agnostic ways to use heuristic search with ML that significantly improves the local ML policy's success rate and scalability. To our best knowledge, we demonstrate the first time ML-based MAPF approaches have scaled to similar high congestion as state-of-the-art heuristic search methods."},{"name":"AI-assisted Tagging of Deepfake Audio Calls using Challenge-Response","publisher":"arXiv (submitted to AsiaCCS 2025)","releaseDate":"2024-02-28","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18085","summary":"Scammers are aggressively leveraging AI voice-cloning technology for social engineering attacks, a situation significantly worsened by the advent of audio Real-time Deepfakes (RTDFs).

Existing literature has largely been ineffective against RTDF threats.
